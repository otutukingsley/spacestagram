# Getting Started with the project

## Shopify Frontend developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2022
This is a project done in accordance to the shopify frontend developer internship challenge for summer 2022

### Challenge
We need a webpage that can pull images, and allow the user to “like” and “unlike” their favourite images.

#### Challenge MUST DO's
- Fetch data from one of NASA’s APIs and display the resulting images
- Display descriptive data for each image (for example: title, date, description, etc.)
- Like an image
- Unlike an image

### Technical Requirements of Challenge
- Search results should come from NASA’s free APIs
- Each image result should list at least a title, date of capture (ideally in earth_date) and a button to “like” that image.
- Each image can be “liked”, and a user should be able to undo their “like”
- The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic


### Extra TODO's (optional) - One or More Recommended
- Save likes if the user leaves or reloads the page
- Animate the “like” action (might we suggest a heart?)
- Add a loading state while we wait for NASA’s API to return data
- Create shareable links for each image
- Add a date-picker to be able to browse photos starting from a specific date

#### Extra TODO's Done
- Save likes if the user leaves or reloads the page
- Add a loading state while we wait for NASA’s API to return data

## Images showing the Liked state, the not liked state, and the loading state
